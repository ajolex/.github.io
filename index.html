            Hello, my name is <b>Aubrey Jolex</b>.<br><br>

I define myself as a troubleshooter, always determined to find solutions. Whether fixing faulty data analysis code or tackling research methodological issues, I consistently find ways to overcome such challenges. I am always eager to leverage this skill to tackle global challenges. There are many questions that, when asked and answered through rigorous research, have the potential to drive significant breakthroughs in areas such as poverty reduction. This sparks my desire to further build my scholarly and research skills, enabling me to engage deeply with research, ask the right questions, and find impactful answers. That being said, I aspire to pursue a Ph.D in Development Economics.<br><br>
            
I hold a bachelor's degree in Social Science, majoring in Economics, and a Master's Degree in Economics from the University of Malawi. My academic background provides me with a solid foundation in Quantitative methods and Econometrics, which aligns with my passion for research in Development Economics.<br><br>
            
Through various roles as an RA in diverse settings, I have gained valuable research experience. I conducted research in Malawi, a low-income country, and am currently living and conducting research in the Philippines, a lower-middle-income country.<br>
